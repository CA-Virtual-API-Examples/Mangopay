# Mangopay

This API is a virtualized sample of the Mangopay REST API.  Full details of the latter can be found at
https://docs.mangopay.com/api-references.

The virtualized sample API is divided into the following groups: Users, Wallets.

Full details of the request-response pairs making up the sample API can be seen in the Editor tab.

Note in the "Create a natural user" pair, when executing, values in the request body e.g. "a first name" can be be replaced by any sample string.  The corresponding string will be echoded in the response.

Note the use of the string patterns {{=[:First Name:]}}, {{=[:Last Name:]}}, {{=[:Street Address:]}} and {{=[:Email:]}} in the "Fetch a user" pair. This will generate random first name, last name, street address and email address respectively in the response.
